Hello, I'm Anastasia, graduate student in Applied Mathematics & Bioinformatics at Peter the Great Polytechnical University, Saint-Petersburg. I adore statistics. Moreover, I love it rigorous (though, it hurts). Wait! I'm not a hardcore pure mathematician. I'm a person who struggles to understand all the tiny theoretical details & always has questions.

I've been teaching at Saint-Petersburg Electrotechnical University "LETI" for 3 years now. There are plenty of materials on statistics but usually they either lack rigor or clarity. As a self-learner, I get really distressed when struggling to read textbooks. I believe that unversity-level mathematics can be explained simpler without sacrificing the rigor.

As a researcher I am extremely willing to apply mathematics to real-world problems. Not just use common tools but get all the details of how everything works and why it works. Now I'm in bioinformatics. I used to work at Theodosius Dobzhansy Center for Genome Bioinformatics where did research for my Bachelor's Thesis. It was devoted to construction of a combined statistics from multiple contingency tables in order to identify genomic regions associated with phenotypes in GWAS studies. Now I'm working on accurate imputation project as a part of research in SPbPU and also doing proteomics at Institute of Systems Biology & Medicine, Moscow.
